# MilanBootblock


This is the Bootblock of the Milan Atari clone, as released by Uwe Schneider.

Originally it was compiled with PureC under TOS.

Take caution when experimenting with a new Bootblock.  If something goes wrong you will need to
flash the old Bootblock with an external programmer.

Michael Schwingen used to use a special flash adapter with two flash sockets on one side and a PLCC
adapter on the other side.  With this adapter it was possible to switch between two flash chips.
